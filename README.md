# 🚗 Market Analysis of Electric Vehicle Company using Python & Google Colab  

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **market performance of an Electric Vehicle (EV) company** using Python in **Google Colab**.  
The goal was to derive actionable insights from sales, pricing, and customer data helping understand growth patterns, regional demand, and business opportunities.  

The dataset was first cleaned in **Excel** for consistency and then explored and analyzed using Python libraries.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Understand **sales performance** across time and regions.  
- Identify **key factors** influencing EV sales and growth.  
- Analyze **customer trends**, **pricing patterns**, and **market share distribution**.  
- Visualize insights using **Python-based data visualization tools**.  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python (Google Colab)** → Data analysis, visualization, and reporting  
- **Excel** → Initial data cleaning and inspection  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 🧩 Process & Approach  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Excel)  
- Removed duplicates, null values, and formatting inconsistencies.  
- Verified column names and data types for compatibility with Python libraries.  

### 2️⃣ Data Exploration (Python)  
- Imported the cleaned dataset into Google Colab.  
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand structure and patterns.  
- Analyzed key metrics such as total sales, average price, and growth rate.  

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization  
- Created visualizations to explore:  
  - 📈 Sales trends over time  
  - 🌎 Regional performance comparisons  
  - 🚘 Model-wise revenue contribution  
  - 💰 Price range vs. sales correlation  
- Used **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for interactive and static plots.
